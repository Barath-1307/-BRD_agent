Create geofences around locations 08/29/2024 Feedback A geofence is a virtual perimeter around a specific location. Geofencing allows users to draw zones around places of work, customer sites, and secure areas. You can configure the system to trigger various actions when geofences are crossed by a person or an equipped vehicle. In Dynamics 365 Field Service, the default use case for geofencing is to create a circular perimeter around a service account location and compare it to the changing location of field technicians as measured by their mobile devices running the Field Service mobile app. When a work order geofence is crossed by a field technician, a geofence event record is created and the geofence status is changed from outside to inside , indicating the field technician is inside the geofence. Another geofence event is created as the field technician leaves the geofenced area. Based on entering or leaving a geofenced area, a mobile push notification or custom workflow can be triggered. Prerequisites Connect to Bing Maps to locate service accounts. Set up auto geocoding for addresses to automatically geocode accounts and work orders when addresses are entered. Geocoding an account or work order record populates latitude and longitude values, which are required to place geofences. Enable location tracking, sharing, and auditing and test location tracking. Verify geofence processes are active Go to Advanced settings in the legacy settings area and open Processes to ensure the following processes are in an Active state: DeleteGeofenceWhenBookingIsCompletedOrCanceled GenerateGeofenceWhenBookingIsCreated Update Geofence instance coordinates If you have Enhanced Background Processing (Preview) set to Yes in Field Service Settings , enable the geofence Power Automate flows. In this case, you don't need these processes. Go to https://make.powerapps.com/ and select your environment. Go to Solutions > Geofencing for Field Service . Enable the following flows: Flow – DeleteGeofenceWhenBookingIsCompletedOrClosed Flow – GenerateGeofenceWhenBookingIsCreated Flow – UpdateGeofenceInstanceCoordinates Configure geofencing settings In the Field Service web app, change to the Settings area. Go to Geofencing > Geofencing Settings . Enter a Unit of Measure and Minimum Radius . The smallest geofence that the system supports has a radius of 25.59 feet. Configure geofence entities Configure the settings for the entities that use geofences. Custom geofences using entities other than accounts and bookable resources are supported. In the Field Service web app, change to the Settings area. Go to Geofencing > Entity Configurations . Select Account entity configured for tracking . Enter the following information: Entity: Select Account because work order locations are inherited from the related service account. Latitude / Longitude: Choose the latitude and longitude fields on the account entity that holds the geo coded location; this setting will determine the center of the geofence. Enabled As: Select Geofence because the account serves as a static location that a geofence will surround. Default Radius: Enter a number to represent the radius of the geofence around the latitude and longitude of the account location. The unit of measure will be the unit chosen in the geofence settings in the previous step. Save your changes and select the Bookable resource entity configured for tracking . Enter the following information: Entity: Select Bookable Resource to compare the location of field technicians relative to the service account of the work order. Latitude / Longitude: Choose the latitude and longitude fields on the bookable resource entity that hold the most recent coordinates of the location. Timestamp Field Name: Choose the location time stamp. This time stamp represents the date and time when the geofence location was updated. Geofence status will be updated only if the status is different than the current status and the time stamp is more recent than the time stamp associated with the current geofence status. Enabled As: Select Geo tracked because the bookable resource has a variable location that is compared against defined geofences. Understand what happens when booking a work order Booking a work order now triggers an asynchronous workflow that creates a geofence. To view the geofences that the system created, go to Field Service > Settings > Geofences . Before traveling to the work order location, the technician is outside the geofence and the system creates an exit geofence event. When a technician arrives at the location and opens the Field Service mobile app, an enter geofence event is created. Entering a geofence also changes the related geofence Geo tracked record status from Outside to Inside . When the technician leaves the geofence, another "exit" event will be created. Tip For testing purposes, if you can't physically travel to a location, expand the geofence radius to include your current location. Manage geofence trigger filters Geofence trigger filters define when a geofence event will trigger, relative to time values of the booking. When geofencing is enabled, the system creates geofences for all bookings, which can result in performance issues if there are many bookings. Geofence trigger filters allow you to define a time window within which the geofence will be created and events can be triggered. Along with performance improvements, these filters can help avoid false-positive geofence events. By filtering upcoming service appointments, you can avoid a scenario where a technician inadvertently travels through a geofence that isn't currently their active engagement. When trigger filters are enabled, you can set time-based filters. Filtered fields include: Start Time End Time Actual Arrival Time Created On Estimated Arrival Time Modified On Offline Time Stamp Record Created On You can then set a value in days before or after the related date for the filter. For example, it could enable trigger filters based on start time with last/next days value of one. The system now only creates a geofence and triggers events for bookings that start between yesterday and tomorrow. Feedback Was this page helpful?

Enable automatic address geocoding 11/08/2024 Feedback Geocoding is the process of transforming text-based address descriptions into geographical coordinates. Dynamics 365 Field Service coordinate to estimate travel times when scheduling a work order to a resource. The Auto Geo Code Addresses setting enables the system to automatically get coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on the address of a service account or a resource. Prerequisites To use geocoding or location services, you need to enable on maps. For more information, see Connect to maps . Enable automatic geocoding Open the Field Service app. Change to the Settings area and then choose Field Service Settings . In Other tab, set Auto Geo Code Addresses to Yes . Select Save . The geocoding process in Field Service uses only one street field ( Street1 ). Additional information like apartment number in Street2 and Street3 is ignored. Don't add the extended information to Street1 . The string length could be too long to process. Tip When the system finds no geocode match, it returns the value (0,0). Any custom logic that uses geocoding should ignore these results to avoid incorrect locations and travel routes. Get coordinates for an address on a record Open a work order or a service account. Ensure the address is accurate. On the command bar, select Geo Code . On the map dialog box, make sure you have the correct address, and then select Change . Feedback Was this page helpful?

Enable location tracking 04/24/2025 Feedback Field technicians often travel to various locations throughout their workday, and it's helpful for schedulers to know where technicians are at any given time. An administrator enables location tracking for the Dynamics 365 Field Service app and technicians enable location sharing from the mobile app. Schedulers can visualize technician's locations on the schedule board and see their location history. For a guided walkthrough, check out the following video. Prerequisites Administrator access to Dynamics 365 Field Service. Read access to the msdyn_geolocationsetting table for the security role of mobile app users. These permissions are included with the default Field Service - Resource role. Enable tracking To send a technician's location information to Field Service, enable location tracking in the web application. In the Field Service web app, change to the Settings area. Go to Geolocation > Geolocation Settings . Select the current setting or create a new one. Set Enable Location Tracking to Yes . Enter a Refresh interval in seconds to define how often the system checks the location information. We recommend values between 60 and 300 seconds. Set the Tracking Times by day for when you want the system to track location data. The start time must be set to occur before the end time. For 24 hours, select 12:00 am to 11:59 pm. Select Save & Close . Share location from the mobile app The app prompts users to allow location access after signing in to the app. The app requests permissions for precise location that are required to update the location consistently. Revoking the listed permissions or not allowing them in the first place keeps the location tracking disabled. To change the permissions retroactively, open the app permissions settings on your mobile device and allow the permissions. iOS app Android app Windows app To have location tracking work properly, allow the app to use Precise Location and set the location tracking to Always allow in the device settings. To have location tracking work properly, complete all the following steps when prompted. Depending on the Android OS version, some steps might not appear or might look slightly different. In the Field Service mobile app, select Start location tracking or Update settings . Select Precise Location and then Allow all the time to ensure the app uses the accurate location. Set Battery optimization to Don't optimize to allow the Field Service app to update the location consistently. Location tracking is currently not available in the Dynamics 365 Field Service Windows app that you can get from the Microsoft Store. Verify that location tracking works In the Field Service web application, open the schedule board and select a resource that has location tracking enabled. The current location of the resource appears on the schedule board map. Note Dispatchers can use current locations for schedule assistant travel time calculations by selecting Real time mode in the schedule assistant filter pane. For more information, see Advanced filters for the schedule assistant . Location tracking events The Geolocation Tracking (msdyn_geolocationtracking) table stores location information. Users location is captured at the frequency in the Refresh interval . The users location is sent to the server and stored only during the set Tracking Times . You can view the table in Power Apps. Note Location tracking events might be sent less frequently based on the mobile device operating system. The frequency might be influenced by battery savings settings, device battery charge status, and other applications running on the device that might consume device resources. You can configure how far back in time a geolocation is valid. This setting is important for scenarios when a mobile device loses internet connection, making dispatchers unaware of the true location. The time threshold can be configured in Resource Scheduling Settings area. Select Administration > Scheduling Parameter . On the Geo Data tab, select Geo Location Expires After X Minutes .

Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management overview 12/10/2024 Feedback Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (Defender EASM) continuously discovers and maps your digital attack surface to give you an external view of your online infrastructure. Defender EASM gives your security and IT teams essential visibility to help them identify unknowns, prioritize risk, eliminate threats, and extend control of vulnerabilities and exposure beyond the firewall. Attack surface insights are generated by using vulnerability and infrastructure data to showcase key areas of concern for your organization. Discovery and inventory Microsoft proprietary discovery technology recursively searches for infrastructure through observed connections to known legitimate assets. It makes inferences about that infrastructure's relationship to the organization to uncover previously unknown and unmonitored properties. These known legitimate assets are called discovery seeds . Defender EASM first discovers strong connections to these selected entities, and then recurses to unveil more connections and ultimately compile your attack surface. Defender EASM discovery includes the following kinds of assets: Domains IP address blocks Hosts Email contacts Autonomous system numbers (ASNs) Whois organizations Discovered assets are indexed and classified in your Defender EASM inventory to give you a dynamic record of the entire web infrastructure under your management. Assets are categorized as recent (currently active) or historic . They can include web applications, third-party dependencies, and other asset connections. Dashboards Defender EASM uses dashboards to help you quickly understand your online infrastructure and any key risks to your organization. The dashboards are designed to provide insight on specific areas of risk, including vulnerabilities, compliance, and security hygiene. These insights help you quickly address the components of your attack surface that pose the greatest risk to your organization. Asset management You can filter your inventory to surface the insights that are most important to you and your organization. Filtering gives you flexibility and customization to help you access a specific subset of assets. Filtering also puts Defender EASM data to work for your specific use case, whether you're searching for assets that connect to deprecating infrastructure or identifying new cloud resources. User permissions A user in your organization who is assigned the Owner or Contributor role can create, delete, and edit Defender EASM resources and the inventory assets in a resource. The Owner and Contributor roles have permissions to use all of the platform's capabilities and features. A user who is assigned the Reader role can view Defender EASM data, but they can't create, delete, or edit a resource or inventory asset. Data residency, availability, and privacy Microsoft Defender EASM contains both global data and customer-specific data. The underlying internet data is global data that originates with Microsoft. Labels that customers apply are considered customer data. Your customer data is stored in the region you select. For security purposes, Microsoft collects a user's IP address when the user signs in. The IP address is stored for up to 30 days, but it can be stored longer if it's needed to investigate potential fraudulent or malicious use of the product. If an Azure region is down, only the Defender EASM customers in that region are affected. Services and data in other Azure regions continue to be active. If an organization is no longer a customer of Microsoft, the Microsoft compliance framework requires all the customer's data to be deleted within 180 days. This policy includes customer data that's stored in offline locations, such as database backups. After a resource is deleted, it can't be restored by our teams. Customer data is retained in our data stores for another 75 days, but the actual resource can't be restored. After the 75-day period, customer data is permanently deleted. Related content Deploy the Defender EASM Azure resource Understanding inventory assets What is discovery?
